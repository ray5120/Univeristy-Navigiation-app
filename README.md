# Own-the-street-app

Brief:
Coventry University's main campus is distributed through over twenty buildings in the city centre. In september each year the university has a large influx of new students who may need assistance to locate classes and services. While the university's primary concern is students, there are other visitors throughout the year who may also need assistance navigating the campus. (Hint: Previous teams found GPS and Google Maps ineffective, so you'll need to think outside the box).

This is an app project that was made for Coventry Univeristy. This module is called real world project. I was reponsible for creating a future app that can help Students in Coventry to navigate blocks and building. I created the icon for the app as well as the functionaility and design. The app is made under android studio(Java).

The most important feature was the fingerprint that i have implemented in android studio.
